# Boundary-Resizer
Free small java app for resizing jpg/png images and auto converting .png to .jpg. 

<strong>Intro</strong> <br>
I have built this app when I was working as a blogger. I had repeating boring tasks such as resizing images and converting png to jpg. so I decided to build this app.  <br>
<br>

Please don't judge me on the poor coding or design. I had no experience in programming and all I cared about at this time was making this app as soon as possible to get the job done.<br>
<br>

<strong>How to use</strong> 


<ol type="1">
  <liOpen Boundary Resizer V.1.jar</li>
  <li>Add images folder by clicking folder button at Input section and choose a folder from the popup window then click open.  </li>
  <li>Add the output folder for the resized and converted images by clicking folder button at the Output section and choose a folder from the pop-up window then click open</li>
  <li>At size section add the width in (W) and the height in (H) and click change. Ex. w: 640 H: 800. Note the size in Pixels. <br>
  Tips: For best result for keeping aspect ratio enter exact width but for height enter a maximum height  <br>
  ex: I have imageOne.jpg is 450x680px and imageTwo.<strong>png</strong> 500x800px. I want to resize the width only to be 700px with keeping aspect ratio: in the size section W: 700 and H:5000. The output will be imageOne.jpg = 700x1058px and imageTwo.<strong>jpg</strong> 700x1120px   </li>
  <li>Finally click start and wait until the process ends and it will display a message "Total No of file: X DONE " open the output folder on your computer for the converted and resized images.</li>
</ol>
